Text::DAWG

A class implementing string set recognition by way of directed acyclic
word graphs.  Written mostly out of spite since someone claimed on Usenet
that it couldn't be done in pure Perl.  Can output dot files for Graphviz
to turn into pretty pictures.


PREREQUISITES

perl 5.8 or later.


INSTALLATION

The usual four-stroke process:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
